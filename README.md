# ActiveRecordQueryCount

`ActiveRecordQueryCount` is a Ruby gem designed to help you visualize and track the SQL queries executed by your ActiveRecord models within a block of code.

By subscribing to ActiveSupport notifications, it provides detailed insights into the number of queries being run, the time taken by the code at specific locations (by adding the time each query took in that place), the tables involved, and the locations in your code where the queries were generated.

This gem offers three key features:

1. View an overview of all queries executed by a block of code, including the time taken and their origin locations, presented in a graph, an HTML table, or directly in the console.
2. Benchmark two blocks of code to compare SQL query counts at different locations, with results displayed in a graph or table.
3. Get an overview of SQL queries for the current request in a controller action, accessible via a button in the top-left corner of the screen.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active-record-query-count'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install active-record-query-count
```

## Usage

There are four ways of using this gem:

1. With a block of code

    ```ruby
    require 'active-record-query-count'
    ActiveRecordQueryCount.start_with_block(printer: :html) do
        # your code goes here
    end
    ```

    this will open up a html table with the SQL stats of your code

2. Starting recording manually

    ```ruby
    require 'active-record-query-count'

    ActiveRecordQueryCount.start_recording
    # your code goes here
    ActiveRecordQueryCount.end_recording(printer: :html)
    ```

3. Comparing two blocks of code (only available for html printer)

    ```ruby
    require 'active-record-query-count'
    ActiveRecordQueryCount.compare do |bench|
        bench.code('script1') do
        end
        bench.code('script2') do
        end
        bench.compare!
    end
    ```

    this will open up a graph comparing the quantity of SQL of the two codes

4. Enabling a middleware to see an overview of the current request SQL's in Rack Application.

   This will disponibilize a button on the top left on every request that will open the query count html view of the request on a modal.

   To enable this, there are two ways,
   1. You can enable it by an enviroment variable called `ENABLE_QUERY_COUNT`.
   2. In `config/development.rb` or the initializer of the application.

        ```ruby
          config.after_initialize do
            ActiveRecordQueryCount.configure do |configuration|
              configuration.enable_middleware = true
            end
          end
        ```

### Printing options

There are two ways of displaying the collected queries data, `:console` and `:html`, to select one pass the printer argument to `start_with_block` o `end_recording` methods.

If you use `html` with WSL enviroment, you need to set on your enviroments variables the `WSL_DISTRIBUTION` that you are using, so the dependency Launchy work as expected.

### Configuration options

When visualizing the html table or the console output, tables with less than `ignore_table_count` will not be shown. Also, the amount of locations to show is given by `max_locations_per_table`. If `max_locations_per_table` is set to 0, all locations will be displayed without any limit.

```ruby
config.after_initialize do
    ActiveRecordQueryCount.configure do |configuration|
      # Default values
      configuration.ignore_table_count = 1
      configuration.max_locations_per_table = 4
      configuration.enable_middleware = false
    end
  end
end
```

## Examples of visualization

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
